"""Block personal-info leaks before they hit main.

The repo is public on GitHub, so anything tracked is visible to anyone. This
test fails on PR if a tracked file contains a forbidden personal identifier
(Windows username, hardcoded user-home paths, etc).

Add new patterns to FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS when you spot a new sensitivity.
Patterns that legitimately need to appear in a file (e.g. this test file
itself, where they're defined) go in ALLOWED_FILES.

Discovered by the security audit in PR #105: the Windows username had
leaked into 7 tracked files across multiple PRs. The forward-fix scrubbed
those + this test prevents reintroduction. The git history was rewritten
separately to remove the pattern from old commits.

# Patterns that must NOT appear in any tracked file. Case-sensitive.
# When adding here, also consider whether existing matches need cleanup.
#
# Patterns are constructed at runtime via string concatenation so the
# literal sensitive value does NOT appear as a Python string constant
# in source. This makes the file safe to pass through future
# `git filter-repo --replace-text` runs (which would otherwise rewrite
# any literal match in this file too -- the bug PR #107 fixes).

    # personal config, not project documentation. Don't reintroduce
