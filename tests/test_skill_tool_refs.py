"""Guard: every tool name a bundled skill presents as callable must exist in
the bridge ``TOOLS`` catalog.

The ``driving-unreal`` skill names ~50 tools in prose. PR #238 cross-checked
those by hand ("zero invented names", catching spec-era drift such as
``set_material_instance_parameter`` -> ``set_mi_parameter`` and
``get_sequence_info`` -> ``inspect_sequence``). This test automates that
check so future recipe edits cannot reintroduce a phantom tool name.

Extraction: backtick-quoted lowercase identifiers in ``skills/**/*.md``. A
candidate that is not a real tool is flagged when it is *tool-shaped* --
either multi-word snake_case (the shape of nearly every tool) or a close
miss of a real tool name (so a single-word tool like ``unsubscribe`` is
still covered even though it carries no underscore). Documented vocabulary
-- parameter names, error codes, anti-example tool names the docs say do NOT
exist -- is listed in ``NON_TOOL_TOKENS`` and excluded.
